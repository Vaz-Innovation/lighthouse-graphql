# Changelog

All notable changes to `lighthouse-graphql` are documented here. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-23

Release tooling only: the library is unchanged from `0.1.0`. The packaged gem differs because
`spec.files` ships the README and this file.

### Changed

- The release workflow asks RubyGems whether the version is already published and skips the
  push if it is. RubyGems refuses to overwrite a version, so without that check a release that
  failed *after* the push — a flaky GitHub API call, a changelog section that did not parse —
  could never be re-run to completion.
- The README carries gem, CI and license badges.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-23

First release on RubyGems. Everything below is what the gem ships with; the library
had been running inside a private monorepo as a path gem before being extracted.

### Added

- Registry-driven directive dispatch (`Lighthouse::DirectiveRegistry`): adding a
  directive is "write one class and register it" — no edits to the generator.
- Directive contracts (`Lighthouse::Contracts::*`) mirroring PHP Lighthouse's
  interfaces: `FieldResolver`, `FieldMiddleware`, `FieldManipulator`,
  `ArgManipulator`, `ArgBuilder`.
- Read directives: `@all`, `@find`, `@first`, `@paginate`, `@count`,
  `@aggregate`, `@hasMany`, `@hasOne`, `@belongsTo`, `@belongsToMany`,
  `@field`, `@rename`, `@auth`, `@builder`, `@orderBy`, and the argument
  filters `@eq`, `@neq`, `@in`, `@notIn`, `@like`, `@where`, plus
  `@whereConditions` / `@whereHasConditions`.
- `@method(name:)` — resolve a field by calling a method on the parent object
  (PHP-parity); removes one-line "call a method" resolvers.
- Authorization directives `@guard` (require authentication) and `@can`
  (policy-based authorization, Pundit by default) with configurable
  `authenticated_user` / `policy_user` / `authorizer` seams — declare auth in
  the schema instead of in resolvers.
- `BuilderApplier` / argument builders now re-raise `GraphQL::ExecutionError`
  instead of swallowing it, so authorization/scoping guards in a builder cannot
  be silently bypassed.
- Central naming module (`Lighthouse::Support::Naming`): one rule mapping GraphQL
  camelCase to Rails snake_case attributes/columns, with `@rename` as the
  explicit override.
- Programmatic directive SDL: registered directives contribute their own
  `directive @name(...) on ...` definitions, so apps need not hand-declare them.
- Apollo Federation entity binding: `@key`/`@extends`/`@shareable`/
  `@inaccessible` and `resolve_reference`, with a default model-lookup fallback
  for direct-model entities and a `ReferenceResolver` registry for custom ones.
- Config-driven extension seams: `Lighthouse.configure`, `resolver_namespaces`,
  `on_error`, and `DirectiveRegistry.register` for app-defined directives.
